TODO:

Display:
	
	display user profile in my-routes (pic/name)
	who suggested the route
	Login changes to Logout once logged in
	show current page in mobile view
	show users how to add their own routes
	show upcoming routes without ability to vote when not logged in
	on login page explain to user that strava is purely used for authentication and they don't need to use strava. Also it's used for easily creating routes. (on desktop)
	display more route details
	make better favicon and do this - https://andrewlock.net/adding-favicons-to-your-asp-net-core-website-with-realfavicongenerator/
	display something when no map routes exist
	Figure out what to do with multiple days, and different groups on the same day
	use dynamic css instead of updating in javascript on expanding navbar in mobile, and re-naming carousel routes to main-view-list

	Display error message when server is down and user tries interact with server
	DONE: Show who voted in upcoming trails
	DONE: Sort most voted map first

	EndGoal: position items in a visually appealing way for both desktop and mobile

Database:

	Every day at 5pm upcoming trails are deleted

	Reduce strava api calls
		600/15min
		30000 daily
		
		use something more permanent than a session to allow the user to stay logged in longer
		DONE: only use strava api calls on login
		DONE: such as get profile info, and routes (2 queries)
		DONE: strava api redirect dynamically to hosted ip, localhost, 192.168.1.*, etc
	
	separate database/server objects from view objects since view objects contain way more data than is needed
	
Security:

	use https with free cert from google
		would need to update api calls also

	check if user's access_token has expired, and if so use the refresh token to get a new one
		This is important because if the user stays logged in more than 6 hours, strava api calls will stop working
		http://developers.strava.com/docs/authentication/
		
	login should occur on aspnetcore side instead of using sessionTest because a local proxy could reply with true when the session doesn't exist
		possibly add service that checks cookie on initial page load
	
	DONE: verify user is still logged in after server restarts, if not redirect to login
		currently user_id session invalidates on server restarts, but users can send api calls

Functionality:

	implement logout
	
	modify vue and aspnet to run in production
		then create a docker image and host on unraid server
		
	use webhooks to automatically update a users route maps? http://developers.strava.com/docs/webhooks/
	
	DONE: implement voting
